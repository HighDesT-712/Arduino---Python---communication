What is the best way to detect faces and to send the answer to your arduino?
this is what I did and what I learned.
Sometimes we could have problems with baud rate
configuration in our arduino or we could dont understan how the connection
between arduino and python works, but we wanna develop programs that use 
neural networks and arduino because both united are a powerful tool and could be improved
I decided to do this program to understand  betterthis kind of project.

For serial communication in arduino IDE, you can easily use Serial library 
For Python you use import serial
For Python neural network  you can use cvzone library, i have to say
they have created a very useful library that let us use efficient
commands, the neural network they use in their library based on BlazeFace, based on SSD algorithm
you just have to download the .zip i am sharing to you in this repository and 
read all the functions defined in its .py codes.

The baud rate that i used is 115200. but you can use, what ever you have, or you choose
the problem is that when you try to use that baudrate in cvzone example for reading data from 
arduino in python, you could have problems if you dont modify the libraries as well
as you modified the main codes of arduino and python, for that in my program
 I only used cvzone library for detecting objects(the neural networks detection)
and the rest of the program was created with serial library and cv2(of course)

I almost forgot, if I are using an external camera for detecting objects
you have to change this line of code in python  :  cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

Read the Readme.md xD
